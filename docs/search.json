Common examples include pay (in pounds) or working time (in hours). For example, for time, the gap between 1 hour and 2 hours is 1 hour, as is the gap between 10 hours and 11 hours, thus the intervals are identical across the scale.\nUnivariate techniques for continuous variables include:\n\nhistograms,\nmeasures of central tendency (e.g. mean, median or mode),\nand measures of dispersion (e.g. standard deviation, variance, standard error, interquartile range.",

    "text": "Exercises developed by Jen Buckley\nAre some people more satisfied with their work-life balance?\nIn this exercise, you will use correlation and regression to examine satisfaction with work-life balance 🙂⚖️, including:\n\nthe correlation between satisfaction with work-life balance and satisfaction with a person’s financial situation. ⚖️💰\nhow satisfaction with work-life balance is related to financial satisfaction, gender and full-time/part-time work. ⚖️⚧️⏲️\n\n\nLearning outcomes\nThe learning outcomes of this section are:\n\ncan use correlation to examine the relationship between continuous variables.\ncan create regression models to examine relationship between variables including adding dummy variables.\n\n\n\nCorrelation\nTo start examining the relationship between satisfaction with work-life balance and satisfaction with financial situation, we will examine correlations between the following variables:  \n\nMCZ_13 Overall, how satisfied are you with the balance between the time spend on paid job and the time spend on other aspects of life?\nMCZ_10 Overall, how satisfied are you with your financial situation?\nMCZ_7 Overall, how satisfied are you with your physical health?\n\nUse the SPSS menus:\n\nAnalyze &gt; Correlate &gt; Bivariate.\nAdd MCZ_13, MCZ_7 and MCZ_10 to the Variables list.\nOK.\n\nIn the output window, examine the results.\n\nQuestionsAnswers\n\n\nIs satisfaction with work life-balance correlated with\n\nSatisfaction with physical health?\nSatisfaction with financial situation?\n\n\n\nYes, there are statistically significant weak positive correlations:\n\n0.24 (p&lt;0.001).\n0.26 (p&lt;0.001).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimple regression\nWe are going to try to further understand satisfaction with work-life balance by using regression. We will create three regression models. Each model will include an additional variable:\n\nModel 1: Satisfaction with financial situation\nModel 2: Satisfaction with financial situation and gender\nModel 3: Satisfaction with financial situation, gender, and full-time/part-time.\n\n\nModel 1\nTo make the first model,\n\nAnalyze &gt; Regression &gt; Linear\nUnder dependent variable, add the variable MCZ_13.\nUnder independent variable, add the variable MCZ_10.\nClick OK.\n\nCheck your results - can you match the results to those in the table below (with some rounding!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables\nModel 1\n(B unstandardised coefficients)\n\n\nConstant\n5.096\n\n\nSatisfaction with financial situation\n0.260 (0.029) **\n\n\nMale\n-\n\n\nFulltime\n-\n\n\nR2\n0.07\n\n\n\nNote: * p-values less than 0.05 and ** p-values less than 0.001.\n\nQuestionsAnswers\n\n\n\nFor every unit increase in satisfaction with financial situation, how much does satisfaction with work-life balance increase or decrease?\nHow much of the variation does satisfaction with financial situation accounts for in satisfaction with work life-balance?\nWhat might these results suggest about the relationship?\n\n\n\n\nAccording to this model, for a unit increase in satisfaction with financial situation, satisfaction with work-life balance increases by 0.26.\nThe model indicates that satisfaction with financial situation is associated with around 6.6% of the variance in satisfaction with work life-balance.\nThere is a relationship between financial satisfaction and satisfaction with work-life balance. Is it causal i.e. does financial satisfaction lead to greater satisfaction with work-life balance? We don’t know from these results. Moreover, the R2 value indicates that if financial satisfaction has some influence on work-life balance satisfaction, other factors explain most of the variance in work-life satisfaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDummy variables\nCategorical variables need to be added to regression models as dummy variables with calues of 0 or 1.\nWe therefore need to recode some variables in preparation for the next steps in our model building, where we add gender and full-tim/part-time.\nOpen a synax file. Copy and run the code below.\n\n*create dummy variables for sex, part-time/full-time work. \n\nRECODE RSEX (1=1) (2=0) (ELSE=SYSMIS) into Male.\nFREQUENCIES Male. \n\nRECODE FtPtWkr (1=1) (2=0) (ELSE=SYSMIS) into Fulltime. \nCROSSTABS FtPtWkr BY Fulltime.\n\n\nMultiple regression\nThe next step is to create models with two independent variables.\n\nModel 2\nCreate Model 2 by adding gender to the model. Use the new variable named Male. This is a dummy variable coded as 1=Male and 0=Female.\n\nAnalyze &gt; Regression &gt; Linear\nUnder dependent variable, add the variable MCZ_13\nUnder independent variable, add the variable MCZ_10 and Male\nClick OK\n\n\nQuestionsAnswers\n\n\n\nWhat can we conclude about gender differences in satisfaction with work-life balance?\nDoes including gender increase the R2 value?\n\n\n\n\nAccording to this model, on average, males are less happy with their work-life balance than females when control for differences in satisfaction with financial situation i.e. the negative association is independent of satisfaction with financial situation.\nWhen we add gender there is a very small increase in the R2 value. So still lots of variation in satisfaction unexplained by the model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel 3\nRepeat the above process to add the binary variable Fulltime indicating whether someone works full- or part-time to the model.\nCheck your results, match the results in the table below (with rounding!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables\nModel 1\nModel 2\nModel 3\n\n\nConstant\n5.10\n5.351\n5.87\n\n\nSatisfaction with financial situation\n0.26 (0.03) ***\n0.252 (0.29)**\n0.268 (0.029)**\n\n\nMale\n-\n-..428 (0.13)**\n-0.39 (0.135)\n\n\nFulltime\n-\n-\n-1.187 (0.145)**\n\n\nR2\n0.066\n0.076\n0.13\n\n\n\nNote: * p-values less than 0.05 and ** p-values less than 0.001.\n\nQuestionsAnswers\n\n\n\nWhat can you conclude about the relationship between working full or part-time and satisfaction with work-life balance?\nWhen we account for working full-time, what happens to the gender difference in satisfaction with work-life balance?\nDoes the value of R2 increase?\n\n\n\n\nWorking full-time is associated with lower satisfaction with work-life balance, with an average score -1..187 lower than those working part-time, controlling for differences in satisfaction with financial situation and gender.\nAccounting for differences between full-time and part-time employment, the difference between males and females reduces and is no longer statistically significant. (Why? Perhaps males are less satisfied on average because more men work full-time.)\nThe R2 value increases when we added Fulltime to the model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrediction\nYou can use the results of the regression model to estimate values for people with specific criteria.\nIn this case, let’s predict someone’s satisfaction with their work-life balance if they are male, work full-time and score 7 on their satisfaction with their financial situation.\nThis is the regression equation\n= constant + B1 (MCZ_10) + B2(Male) + B3 (Fulltime)\nAdd the values and calculate the score.\n=5.873 + 0.27(7) -0.04(1) -1.19(1)\n=5.87+1.89-0.04-1.19\n=6.53\n\nQuestionsAnswers\n\n\nCalculate the score for a female working part-time who is equally satisfied with their financial situation?\n\n\n=5.873 + 0.27(7) -0.04(0) -1.19(1)\n=5.87+1.89-1.19\n=7.72\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtra\n\nCan you think of any problems with this model? For example, are there important factors left out? Do you agree with decisions about dependent and independent variables?\nAdd one of the following variables to the model\n\nSelf-rated health (remember about dummy variables)\nSatisfaction with health",
