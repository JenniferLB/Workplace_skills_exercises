What is the level of measurement of the two variables?\n\n2.  Which variable has more missing values? Why do you think this is?\n\n## Answers\n\n1.  `RSEX` and `FtPtWKr` are categorical variables with two categories.\n\n2.  `FtPtWKr` has many more missing values. There are 600 system missing values. These are cases where a question about employment was not applicable.\n:::\n\n### Crosstabulation\n\nTo look at the relationship between two categorical variables (nominal or ordinal) we can use a crosstabulation (‘crosstab’).\n\nA crosstabulation involving two variables splits cases across categories of both variables. We see the number of cases in each category for one variable that also belong to each category of another. It tells us about how values of one categorical variable are **conditional** on the values of another.\n\nWe can express this in counts (raw figures) or in percentages. A common practice is to put independent variable in the columns and ask for column percentages.\n\nUse the SPSS menu, to create a crosstabulation:\n\n-   **Analyze \\> Descriptive Statistics \\> Crosstabs**\n\n![](Menu_cross.png)\n\n### Crosstabs dialogue box\n\nIn the crosstabs dialogue box, put the **dependent variable in the ‘row’** and the independent variable in the ‘column’. Therefore,\n\n-   `FtPtWkr` in the row\n\n-   `RSEX` in the column\n\n-   Press OK\n\n![](Cross_dialogue.png)\n\nThis crosstab has separated the sample into Male, Female and Total. The table we get includes counts only.\n\nIt is difficult to interpret!\n\n-   Repeat the steps above and select the Cells box in the crosstabs menu. In the Cells box, under percentages, **select column.**\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Questions\n\nUse the table and decide\n\n1.  What percentage of males work full-time?\n\n2.  Is it higher than the percentage of females who work full-time?\n\n3.  What percentage of everyone works full-time?\n\n## Answers\n\nUse the table and decide:\n\n1.  85% of males who are employed, work full-time.\n\n2.  Yes, only 50% of females who are employed work full-time.\n\n3.  66% of people who are employed, work full-time.\n:::\n\n### What percent of part-time workers are female?\n\nWe now know that women are more likely to work part-time. But what proportion of part-time workers are female? To answer this question, we need to calculate the percentages a different way.\n\n-   **Repeat the steps above but in the Cells box select Row percentages instead of column.**\n\nWe now get different percentages. The table divides the sample into part-time and full-time workers. Use the table and decide:\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Questions\n\n1.  What percent of part-time workers are male?\n\n2.  What percent of part-time workers are female?\n\n## Answers\n\n1.  About 21% of part-time workers are male.\n\n2.  About 79% of part-time workers are female\n:::\n\n## Part 2: Examining levels of satisfaction with work\n\n### Check your variables\n\nHow satisfied are people on average with their work situation? Start by examining the variable `MCZ_11`.\n\n-   **Analyse \\> descriptive statistics \\> Frequencies**\n\n-   **Select appropriate Charts and Statistics**\n\n### Compare means\n\nNow, let's examine if satisfaction with work situation varies by sex.\n\n-   **Analyse \\> Compare Means \\> Means**\n\nIn the box,\n\n-   Add `MCZ_11` to the dependent list.\n\n-   `RSEX` and `FtPtWKR` to Layer 1 of 1.\n\n-   Press OK.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Questions\n\nReview the output and answer the following questions:\n\n1.  What is the mean score for those in full-time work and is it higher or lower than those in part-time work?\n\n2.  What is the mean score for males and is it higher or lower than for females?\n\n## Answers\n\n1.  The mean for those in full-time work is 6.8 – which is slightly higher than those in part-time work (6.61).\n\n2.  Score for males is 6.34, which is slightly lower than the score for females, 6.61.\n:::\n\n### Adding a layer to a table\n\nAs a a final step, let’s look at the difference between males and female part- time workers.\n\n-   **Analyse \\> Compare Means \\> Means**\n\nIn the Means box,\n\n-   Add `MCZ_11` to the dependent list as before\n\n-   Add only `FtPtWKR` to Layer 1 of 1\n\n-   Click Next in the layer box so that it shows Layer 2 of 2\n\n-   Add `Rsex`\n\n-   Click OK\n\nWe now get a table that reports differences by both sex and whether someone is full or part time.\n\n![](images/clipboard-3491958388.png)\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Questions\n\n1.  Which group has the lowest score?\n2.  Is there a differences between male and female part-time workers in terms of their satisfaction with their work situation?\n\n## Answers\n\n1.  Male and part-time\n\n2.  Yes, male part-time workers score lower in their satisfaction with their work situation (5.79) then female part-time workers (6.82) and also male full-time workers.\n:::\n\nHow can we understand these results? Think of reasons why we see this pattern male part-time employees.\n\n## But are these differences statistically significant?\n\nIn this exercise, you have compared groups via a cross-tabulation and by comparing means. Examining these differences gives insight into the relationship between variables in the sample. But it is important to remember that we only have data from a sample. The next exercise looks at how we can build on these analyses to make inferences about the population.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nUse data to explore the following questions:\n\n-   Are there gender differences in part-time employment? ⚧️⏲️\n\n-   How happy are part-time workers with their work situation and does it vary by gender? ⏲️😀⚧️\n\n### Learning outcomes\n\nThe learning outcomes of this section are:\n\n-   aware that the techniques used to examine relationship between different variables depends on the types of variables being considered.\n\n-   can produce cross-tabulations and interpret output such as row and column percentages.\n\n-   can compare means between groups.\n\n## Part 1: Gender differences in part-time employment?\n\n### Explore your variables\n\nStart by creating frequency tables for our first two variables to check their distribution and measurement.\n\nThe variables are:\n\n-   `RSEX` 'Respondent's gender'\n\n-   `FtPtWKr` 'Are you in full-time or part-time employment?'\n\nThe steps are:\n\n-   **Analyse \\> descriptive statistics \\> Frequencies**\n\n> **Tip:** Remember, you can change the list of variables to ‘Display names’.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Questions\n\n1.
