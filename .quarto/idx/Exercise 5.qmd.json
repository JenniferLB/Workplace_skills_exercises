For every unit increase in satisfaction with financial situation, how much does satisfaction with work-life balance increase or decrease?\n\n2.  How much of the variation does satisfaction with financial situation accounts for in satisfaction with work life-balance?\n\n3.  What might these results suggest about the relationship?\n\n## Answers\n\n1.  According to this model, for a unit increase in satisfaction with financial situation, satisfaction with work-life balance increases by 0.26.\n\n2.  The model indicates that satisfaction with financial situation is associated with around 6.6% of the variance in satisfaction with work life-balance.\n\n3.  There is a relationship between financial satisfaction and satisfaction with work-life balance. Is it causal i.e. does financial satisfaction lead to greater satisfaction with work-life balance? We don't know from these results. Moreover, the R^2^ value indicates that if financial satisfaction has some influence on work-life balance satisfaction, other factors explain most of the variance in work-life satisfaction.\n:::\n\n# Dummy variables\n\nCategorical variables need to be added to regression models as dummy variables with calues of 0 or 1.\n\nWe therefore need to recode some variables in preparation for the next steps in our model building, where we add gender and full-tim/part-time.\n\nOpen a synax file.

What can we conclude about gender differences in satisfaction with work-life balance?\n\n2.  Does including gender increase the R^2^ value?\n\n## Answers\n\n1.  According to this model, on average, males are less happy with their work-life balance than females when control for differences in satisfaction with financial situation i.e. the negative association is independent of satisfaction with financial situation.\n\n2.  When we add gender there is a very small increase in the R^2^ value. So still lots of variation in satisfaction unexplained by the model.\n:::\n\n### Model 3\n\nRepeat the above process to add the binary variable i`Fulltime` indicating whether someone works full- or part-time to the model.\n\nCheck your results, match the results in the table below (with rounding!).\n\n+---------------------------------------+--------------------+-------------------+--------------------+\n| Variables                             | Model 1            | Model 2           | Model 3            |\n+---------------------------------------+--------------------+-------------------+--------------------+\n| Constant                              | 5.10               | 5.351             | 5.87               |\n+---------------------------------------+--------------------+-------------------+--------------------+\n| Satisfaction with financial situation | 0.26 (0.03) \\*\\*\\* | 0.252 (0.29)\\*\\*  | 0.268 (0.029)\\*\\*  |\n+---------------------------------------+--------------------+-------------------+--------------------+\n| Male                                  | \\-                 | -..428 (0.13)\\*\\* | -0.39 (0.135)      |\n+---------------------------------------+--------------------+-------------------+--------------------+\n| Fulltime                              | \\-                 | \\-                | -1.187 (0.145)\\*\\* |\n+---------------------------------------+--------------------+-------------------+--------------------+\n| R^2^                                  | 0.066              | 0.076             | 0.13               |\n+---------------------------------------+--------------------+-------------------+--------------------+\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Questions\n\n1.  What can you conclude about the relationship between working full or part-time and satisfaction with work-life balance?\n\n2.  When we account for working full-time, what happens to the gender difference in satisfaction with work-life balance?\n\n3.  Does the value of R^2^ increase?\n\n## Answers\n\n1.  Working full-time is associated with lower satisfaction with work-life balance, with an average score -1..187 lower than those working part-time, controlling for differences in satisfaction with financial situation and gender.\n\n2.  Accounting for differences between full-time and part-time employment, the difference between males and females reduces and is no longer statistically significant. (Why? Perhaps males are less satisfied on average because more men work full-time.)\n\n3.
