For every unit increase in satisfaction with financial situation, how much does satisfaction with work-life balance increase or decrease?\n\n2.  How much of the variation does satisfaction with financial situation accounts for in satisfaction with work life-balance?\n\n3.  What might these results suggest about the relationship?\n\n## Answers\n\n1.  According to this model, for a unit increase in satisfaction with financial situation, satisfaction with work-life balance increases by 0.26.\n\n2.  The model indicates that satisfaction with financial situation is associated with around 6.6% of the variance in satisfaction with work life-balance.\n\n3.  There is a relationship between financial satisfaction and satisfaction with work-life balance. Is it causal i.e. does financial satisfaction lead to greater satisfaction with work-life balance? We don't know from these results. Moreover, the R^2^ value indicates that if financial satisfaction has some influence on work-life balance satisfaction, other factors explain most of the variance in work-life satisfaction.\n:::\n\n# Dummy variables\n\nCategorical variables need to be added to regression models as dummy variables with calues of 0 or 1.\n\nWe therefore need to recode some variables in preparation for the next steps in our model building, where we add gender and full-tim/part-time.\n\nOpen a synax file. Copy and run the code below.\n\n```         \n\n*create dummy variables for sex, part-time/full-time work. \n\nRECODE RSEX (1=1) (2=0) (ELSE=SYSMIS) into Male.\nFREQUENCIES Male. \n\nRECODE FtPtWkr (1=1) (2=0) (ELSE=SYSMIS) into Fulltime. \nCROSSTABS FtPtWkr BY Fulltime.\n```\n\n# Multiple regression\n\nThe next step is to create models with two independent variables.\n\n### Model 2\n\nCreate Model 2 by adding gender to the model. Use the new variable named Male. This is a dummy variable coded as 1=Male and 0=Female.\n\n-   **Analyze \\> Regression \\> Linear**\n\n-   **Under dependent variable, add the variable MCZ_13**\n\n-   **Under independent variable, add the variable MCZ_10 and Male**\n\n-   **Click OK**\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Questions\n\n1.  What can we conclude about gender differences in satisfaction with work-life balance?\n\n2.  Does including gender increase the R^2^ value?\n\n## Answers\n\n1.  According to this model, on average, males are less happy with their work-life balance than females when control for differences in satisfaction with financial situation i.e. the negative association is independent of satisfaction with financial situation.\n\n2.  When we add gender there is a very small increase in the R^2^ value. So still lots of variation in satisfaction unexplained by the model.\n:::\n\n### Model 3\n\nRepeat the above process to add the binary variable `Fulltime` indicating whether someone works full- or part-time to the model.\n\nCheck your results, match the results in the table below (with rounding!).\n\n+---------------------------------------+--------------------+-------------------+--------------------+\n| Variables                             | Model 1            | Model 2           | Model 3            |\n+---------------------------------------+--------------------+-------------------+--------------------+\n| Constant                              | 5.10               | 5.351             | 5.87               |\n+---------------------------------------+--------------------+-------------------+--------------------+\n| Satisfaction with financial situation | 0.26 (0.03) \\*\\*\\* | 0.252 (0.29)\\*\\*  | 0.268 (0.029)\\*\\*  |\n+---------------------------------------+--------------------+-------------------+--------------------+\n| Male                                  | \\-                 | -..428 (0.13)\\*\\* | -0.39 (0.135)      |\n+---------------------------------------+--------------------+-------------------+--------------------+\n| Fulltime                              | \\-                 | \\-                | -1.187 (0.145)\\*\\* |\n+---------------------------------------+--------------------+-------------------+--------------------+\n| R^2^                                  | 0.066              | 0.076             | 0.13               |\n+---------------------------------------+--------------------+-------------------+--------------------+\n\n*Note: \\* p-values less than 0.05 and \\*\\* p-values less than 0.001.*\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Questions\n\n1.  What can you conclude about the relationship between working full or part-time and satisfaction with work-life balance?\n\n2.  When we account for working full-time, what happens to the gender difference in satisfaction with work-life balance?\n\n3.  Does the value of R^2^ increase?\n\n## Answers\n\n1.  Working full-time is associated with lower satisfaction with work-life balance, with an average score -1..187 lower than those working part-time, controlling for differences in satisfaction with financial situation and gender.\n\n2.  Accounting for differences between full-time and part-time employment, the difference between males and females reduces and is no longer statistically significant. (Why? Perhaps males are less satisfied on average because more men work full-time.)\n\n3.  The R^2^ value increases when we added Fulltime to the model.\n:::\n\n### Prediction\n\nYou can use the results of the regression model to estimate values for people with specific criteria.\n\nIn this case, let's predict someone’s satisfaction with their work-life balance if they are male, work full-time and score 7 on their satisfaction with their financial situation.\n\nThis is the regression equation\n\n= constant + B1 (MCZ_10) + B2(Male) + B3 (Fulltime)\n\nAdd the values and calculate the score.\n\n=5.873 + 0.27(7) -0.04(1) -1.19(1)\n\n=5.87+1.89-0.04-1.19\n\n=6.53\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Questions\n\nCalculate the score for a female working part-time who is equally satisfied with their financial situation?\n\n## Answers\n\n=5.873 + 0.27(7) -0.04(0) -1.19(1)\n\n=5.87+1.89-1.19\n\n=7.72\n:::\n\n# Extra\n\n-   Can you think of any problems with this model?
