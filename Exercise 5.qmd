title: "Understanding satisfaction with work-life balance"
---

Are some people more satisfied with their work-life balance?

In this exercise, you will use correlation and regression to examine satisfaction with work-life balance 🙂⚖️, including:

-   the correlation between satisfaction with work-life balance and satisfaction with a person's financial situation. ⚖️💰

-   how satisfaction with work-life balance is related to financial satisfaction, gender and full-time/part-time work. ⚖️⚧️⏲️

### Learning outcomes

The learning outcomes of this section are:

-   can use correlation to examine the relationship between continuous variables.

-   can create regression models to examine relationship between variables including adding dummy variables.

# Correlation

To start examining the relationship between satisfaction with work-life balance and satisfaction with financial situation, we will examine correlations between the following variables:  

-   `MCZ_13` Overall, how satisfied are you with the balance between the time spend on paid job and the time spend on other aspects of life?

-   `MCZ_10` Overall, how satisfied are you with your financial situation?

-   `MCZ_7` Overall, how satisfied are you with your physical health?

Use the SPSS menus:

-   **Analyze \> Correlate \> Bivariate.**

-   **Add `MCZ_13`, `MCZ_7` and `MCZ_10` to the Variables list.**

-   **OK.**

In the output window, examine the results.

## Questions

Is satisfaction with work life-balance correlated with

-   Satisfaction with physical health?

-   Satisfaction with financial situation?

## Answers

Yes, there are statistically significant weak positive correlations:

-    0.24 (p\<0.001).

-   0.26 (p\<0.001).

# Simple regression

We are going to try to further understand satisfaction with work-life balance by using regression. We will create three regression models. Each model will include an additional variable:

-   Model 1: Satisfaction with financial situation

-   Model 2: Satisfaction with financial situation and gender

-   Model 3: Satisfaction with financial situation, gender, and full-time/part-time.

### Model 1

To make the first model,

-   **Analyze \> Regression \> Linear**

-   **Under dependent variable, add the variable MCZ_13.**

-   **Under independent variable, add the variable MCZ_10.**

-   **Click OK.**

Check your results - can you match the results to those in the table below (with some rounding!).

## Questions

1.  For every unit increase in satisfaction with financial situation, how much does satisfaction with work-life balance increase or decrease?

2.  How much of the variation does satisfaction with financial situation accounts for in satisfaction with work life-balance?

3.  What might these results suggest about the relationship?

## Answers

1.  According to this model, for a unit increase in satisfaction with financial situation, satisfaction with work-life balance increases by 0.26.

2.  The model indicates that satisfaction with financial situation is associated with around 6.6% of the variance in satisfaction with work life-balance.

3.  There is a relationship between financial satisfaction and satisfaction with work-life balance. Is it causal i.e. does financial satisfaction lead to greater satisfaction with work-life balance? We don't know from these results. Moreover, the R^2^ value indicates that if financial satisfaction has some influence on work-life balance satisfaction, other factors explain most of the variance in work-life satisfaction.

# Dummy variables

Categorical variables need to be added to regression models as dummy variables with calues of 0 or 1.

We therefore need to recode some variables in preparation for the next steps in our model building, where we add gender and full-tim/part-time.

Open a synax file. Copy and run the code below.

```         

*create dummy variables for sex, part-time/full-time work. 

RECODE RSEX (1=1) (2=0) (ELSE=SYSMIS) into Male.
FREQUENCIES Male. 

RECODE FtPtWkr (1=1) (2=0) (ELSE=SYSMIS) into Fulltime. 
CROSSTABS FtPtWkr BY Fulltime.
```

# Multiple regression

The next step is to create models with two independent variables.

### Model 2

Create Model 2 by adding gender to the model. Use the new variable named Male. This is a dummy variable coded as 1=Male and 0=Female.

-   **Analyze \> Regression \> Linear**

-   **Under dependent variable, add the variable MCZ_13**

-   **Under independent variable, add the variable MCZ_10 and Male**

-   **Click OK**

::: panel-tabset
## Questions

1.  What can we conclude about gender differences in satisfaction with work-life balance?

2.  Does including gender increase the R^2^ value?

## Answers

1.  According to this model, on average, males are less happy with their work-life balance than females when control for differences in satisfaction with financial situation i.e. the negative association is independent of satisfaction with financial situation.

2.  When we add gender there is a very small increase in the R^2^ value. So still lots of variation in satisfaction unexplained by the model.

### Model 3

Repeat the above process to add the binary variable `Fulltime` indicating whether someone works full- or part-time to the model.

Check your results, match the results in the table below (with rounding!).

## Questions

1.  What can you conclude about the relationship between working full or part-time and satisfaction with work-life balance?

2.  When we account for working full-time, what happens to the gender difference in satisfaction with work-life balance?

3.  Does the value of R^2^ increase?

## Answers

1.  Working full-time is associated with lower satisfaction with work-life balance, with an average score -1..187 lower than those working part-time, controlling for differences in satisfaction with financial situation and gender.

2.  Accounting for differences between full-time and part-time employment, the difference between males and females reduces and is no longer statistically significant. (Why? Perhaps males are less satisfied on average because more men work full-time.)

3.  The R^2^ value increases when we added Fulltime to the model.

### Prediction

You can use the results of the regression model to estimate values for people with specific criteria.

In this case, let's predict someone’s satisfaction with their work-life balance if they are male, work full-time and score 7 on their satisfaction with their financial situation.

This is the regression equation

= constant + B1 (MCZ_10) + B2(Male) + B3 (Fulltime)

Add the values and calculate the score.

=5.873 + 0.27(7) -0.04(1) -1.19(1)

=5.87+1.89-0.04-1.19

=6.53

## Questions

Calculate the score for a female working part-time who is equally satisfied with their financial situation?

## Answers

=5.873 + 0.27(7) -0.04(0) -1.19(1)

=5.87+1.89-1.19

=7.72

# Extra

-   Can you think of any problems with this model? For example, are there important factors left out? Do you agree with decisions about dependent and independent variables?

-   Add one of the following variables to the model

    -   Self-rated health (remember about dummy variables)

    -   Satisfaction with health
